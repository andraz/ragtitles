# Ragtitles

**Optimize Subtitles for RAG Ingestion**

This npm module converts standard YouTube autogenerated word-timestamped VTT subtitles into a RAG-friendly format we named _ragtitles_.

This format makes timestamped subtitles token-optimized to be suitable for use with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and injected directly into the context of an LLM prompt, while retaining the 1:1 mapping of words to video timestamps, for reference and playback purposes.

## Installation

```bash
bun add ragtitles
```

## Usage

### Ingest the data

```javascript
import convert from 'ragtitles'

const vttData = `WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.350 align:start position:0%

`

const convertedData = convert(vttData)
```

### Default data is an array for RAG-friendly ingestion

```js
console.log(convertedData)
```

```json
[
  { "time": 0, "text": "lost another colony to Raiders let's" },
  { "time": 2, "text": "make sure the next one doesn't suffer" },
  { "time": 4, "text": "the same fate shall we today we're going" }
]
```

### Can be quickly converted to a string for direct prompt in-context ingestion

```js
const stringData = convertedData.map((d) => `${d.time} ${d.text}`)
console.log(stringData.join('\n'))
```

```
0 lost another colony to Raiders let's
2 make sure the next one doesn't suffer
4 the same fate shall we today we're going
```

## How it works

The `convert` function takes raw VTT data as input and returns an array of objects, where each object represents a sentence with its corresponding timestamp in seconds. This format is more concise and easier for RAG systems to process.

## Sourcing the VTT data

Use `yt-dlp` in the terminal.

Simply replace the link with one you copied from YouTube:

```bash
 yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrbhlNPSwzY --write-auto-subs --skip-download
```

### DevContainer codespace

If you open this project in a DevContainer `yt-dlp` is automatically installed for you.

To open this project in a DevContainer, just click on the green Code button top right on first page of repository, then pick "Create codespace on main". This will create a new DevContainer of your own. It runs inside of a virtual machine which comes with your GitHub account for free.

## Command line utility

You can run the code directly using `cli.js` utility.

It will take a file path as an argument and print the converted data to the console. If you pass it a YouTube URL it will download the subtitles and convert them.

This will work out of the box in the DevContainer codespace as mentioned above, even when started inside your own browser.

### With VTT file

If you downloaded the file yourself, pass the filename in the command:

```bash
bun cli.js filename.vtt
```

### Without VTT file

If you want to download the subtitles from YouTube automatically, just pass the URL as an argument:

```bash
bun cli.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVS7MsQk4Y
```

Adding the time parameter, will make all lines prefixed with an integer value of seconds from the start of the video.

```bash
bun cli.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVS7MsQk4Y --time
```

### Example with timestamps

Print first 10 ragtitles of the video:

```bash
bun cli.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVS7MsQk4Y --time | head -n 10
```

```

You can remove everything after the `|` pipe character in the command, to get the full output.

### Example text snippet from short time after the start of the video

To get rid of the seconds at the start of each line, we remove the `--time` parameter.

We use a combination of `tail` and `head`, to get a snip of text that happens short time after the beginning of the video.

We add `tr` to remove newlines and get a single line of text.

```bash
bun cli.js https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVS7MsQk4Y | head -n 50 | tail -n 20 | tr '\n' ' '
```

sensitive resin that's used in SLA printers or the resist that's used to manufacture pcbs the only difference really is in size chips are very small and so the pattern we put on the chip also has to be really small I've dealt with photo lithography a little bit in the past and the Machine I made was well charitably it wasn't very good in fact it was basically unusable other than as a demonstration I've also done some Electron Beam lithography in the past and it's perfect for really small features I've been working on some vacuum transistors that have gaps just a few hundred nanometers wide but my machine isn't really designed for patterning large areas so if you watch my DIY camera sensor video you'll have seen all the issues I had wit

You can tweak the numbers as you wish, to simplify passing quickly just the right amount of the context you need.
