# Ragtitles

**Optimize Subtitles for RAG Ingestion**

This npm module converts standard YouTube autogenerated word-timestamped VTT subtitles into a RAG-friendly format we named _ragtitles_.

This format makes timestamped subtitles token-optimized to be suitable for use with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and injected directly into the context of an LLM prompt, while retaining the 1:1 mapping of words to video timestamps, for reference and playback purposes.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ragtitles
```

## Usage

### Ingest the data

```javascript
import { convert } from 'ragtitles'

const vttData = `WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.350 align:start position:0%

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.360 align:start position:0%

make sure the next one doesn't suffer


00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.789 align:start position:0%
make sure the next one doesn't suffer
the<00:00:04.520><c> same</c><00:00:04.839><c> fate</c><00:00:05.279><c> shall</c><00:00:05.640><c> we</c><00:00:06.040><c> today</c><00:00:06.399><c> we're</c><00:00:06.680><c> going</c>

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
the same fate shall we today we're going

`

const convertedData = convert(vttData)
```

### Default data is an array for RAG-friendly ingestion

```js
console.log(convertedData)
```

```json
[
  { "time": 0, "text": "lost another colony to Raiders let's" },
  { "time": 2, "text": "make sure the next one doesn't suffer" },
  { "time": 4, "text": "the same fate shall we today we're going" }
]
```

### Can be quickly converted to a string for direct prompt in-context ingestion

```js
const stringData = convertedData.map((d) => `${d.time} ${d.text}`)
console.log(stringData.join('\n'))
```

```
0 lost another colony to Raiders let's
2 make sure the next one doesn't suffer
4 the same fate shall we today we're going
```

## How it works

The `convert` function takes raw VTT data as input and returns an array of objects, where each object represents a sentence with its corresponding timestamp in seconds. This format is more concise and easier for RAG systems to process.

## Sourcing the VTT data

Use `yt-dlp` in the terminal.

Simply replace the link with one you copied from YouTube:

```bash
 yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrbhlNPSwzY --write-auto-subs --skip-download
```

### DevContainer codespace

If you open this project in a DevContainer `yt-dlp` is automatically installed for you.

To open this project in a DevContainer, just click on the green Code button top right on first page of repository, then pick "Create codespace on main". This will create a new DevContainer of your own. It runs inside of a virtual machine which comes with your GitHub account for free.
